I tried the block theme - but will work with 'classic' theme for now:
1. block theme didn't work! the homepage/front-page resolved to page.html template - don't know how to change this.
   such an obvious requirement - bad start.
2. legacy sites will def. be in 'classic' - I will check how much people are using both, 
   but i suspect 'classic' php files are still very popular.
3. I don't like the DSL they have created in their html template files - namely using html comments
   to add 'blocks'. While it's declarative and you're working in html - which is nice - they throw those
   advantages away by using json inside the 'block' comments - so messy and overkill.
   would have been far nicer to retain html styling tag and integrate that.. shame, cause otherwise nice.
